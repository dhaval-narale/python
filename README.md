Problem Statement:
You are tasked with developing a simple coffee machine simulation program that can serve three types of coffee: espresso, latte, and cappuccino. The machine has limited resources, such as water, milk, and coffee, and accepts payment in coins. The program should be able to perform the following tasks:

Display a Menu: Show the user the available coffee options and their respective costs.

Resource Management: Before making a coffee, check if there are enough resources (water, milk, coffee) to fulfill the order. If any resource is insufficient, the machine should notify the user and cancel the order.

Coin Processing: Accept coins from the user and calculate the total amount of money inserted. The program should recognize quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.

Transaction Handling: Determine if the inserted money is enough to cover the cost of the chosen coffee. If sufficient, the machine should deduct the cost from the user's payment, provide change, and update the total profit. If not, the program should refund the money and cancel the transaction.

Coffee Preparation: If the transaction is successful and there are sufficient resources, the machine should deduct the required ingredients from the available resources and serve the coffee to the user.

Reporting: Provide the user with a report showing the remaining resources (water, milk, coffee) and the total profit earned by the machine.

Machine Control: Allow the user to turn off the machine or request a report on the current state of resources and profit.
